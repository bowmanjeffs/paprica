#### Complete pathways follow the form /home/user/genome_finder/ and there should be no
#### space before or after the equal sign.

#### The default pathways are not in this form to facilitate a quick start for the
#### inpatient (such as myself), but if you are reading this please change to full paths
#### to insure full functionality.
